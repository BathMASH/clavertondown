Since the user can define any number of these we have to… guess… to try and align colours. We have four HTML styles: DefinitionStyle ExampleStyle TheoremStyle ProofStyle Our assignment is NOT currently based, at all, on the PDF styling specified by the author, or any other information like e.g. numberwith. LaTeX styling, while originally intended to broadly correspond to semantic type is not used this way by authors due to the fonts which are imposed in standard LaTeX. So, the three styles in LaTeX: Plain Definition Remark are used to impose the authors visual preferences mostly with respect to font, font attributes and layout. "],["there-are-two-different-issues-here.html", "2 There are two different issues here", " 2 There are two different issues here Case 1 (HTML output): Author makes a newtheorem and it defaults to TheoremStyle but might not be a theorem. Author has styled the newtheorem in LaTeX. Try: To use numberwith information e.g. if a new environment is numbered with definitions AND has fallen through the best guessing assign style of what it is numbered with Try: Failing the above, where a style_with is specified try Definition styling -&gt; DefinitionStyle; remark styling -&gt; ExampleStyle; plain styling -&gt; TheoremStyle Case 2 (PDF output): Author makes a newtheorem and I make a best guess at the HTML styling. Author has not styled the newtheorem in LaTeX. Try: DefinitionStyle -&gt; the style of definition environment (either inbuilt or as reassigned by user); ExampleStyle -&gt; the style of example environment (either inbuilt or as reassigned by user); TheoremStyle -&gt; the style of theorem env (ditto); ProofStyle -&gt; remark (I think that proof style is hard-coded?)
