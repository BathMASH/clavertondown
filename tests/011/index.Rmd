Reported bug is that a document with only unnumbered (declared unnumbered) Examples in fails to compile LaTeX with error that Example* is not defined.

```{newtheorem, env="Example"}
This is a test
```

Replicated. What happens if there is any other numbered thing? It works fine. 

```{newtheorem eval=FALSE, env="Test", include=FALSE, label="test"}
This is a numbered test
```

What if I don't even use that but it is in the _bookdown file? No, that doesn't work. What if I use a numbered inbuilt (with or without a label)? 

```{theorem eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
This is inbuilt without label
```

This works fine too. 

So, there is something that happens only if there are numbered envs in use which affects unnumbered envs and which was introduced within the last 54 weeks. 

Problem is obvious - no theorem things are output at all...   

Fixed in obvious place for bug to be.
