[["index.html", "Test 011: Unnumbered theorems work", " Test 011: Unnumbered theorems work Emma Cliffe, Skills Centre: MASH, University of Bath October 2021 Reported bug is that a document with only unnumbered (declared unnumbered) Examples in fails to compile LaTeX with error that Example* is not defined. Example: This is a test Replicated. What happens if there is any other numbered thing? It works fine. What if I don’t even use that but it is in the _bookdown file? No, that doesn’t work. What if I use a numbered inbuilt (with or without a label)? This works fine too. So, there is something that happens only if there are numbered envs in use which affects unnumbered envs and which was introduced within the last 54 weeks. Problem is obvious - no theorem things are output at all… Fixed in obvious place for bug to be. "]]
