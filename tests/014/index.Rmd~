# Does the Walker work when switched on?

Recently, I've had trouble doing this, and at first, I thought it was related to R Bookdown. I've tried the equation on your ClavertonDown (which I'm going to start experimenting with) and I'm having the same problem. 

Here are the keyboard actions I use.

1. Land on a page with mathjax and equations.
2. Tab to an equation.
3. Press Spacebar to access the accessibility options.
4. Use arrow keys to navigate to Accessibility > Explorer > Active. Press spacebar to activate.
5. With an equation in focus, press Enter.
6. Use down arrow key to explore by sub-expression. Use left and right arrow key to explore equation by sub-expression.

With markdown stuff, I've not had much luck and I'm wondering if there is something about the version of mathjax being used by Markdown or if there is a fight for the keyboard commands that is at play here.

# Testing

Hello world...
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Hypothesis

This is a bug in MathJax 2.7.2 or when this is in use with Markdown generated formats, perhaps. It was confirmed in transformations with this version from RMarkdown and Clavertondown. But with 2.7.9 in Xerte and Bookdown it does not occur.

## Questions

* What controls the version of MathJax in use? Is it (Claverton/Book)down? Is it the version of Pandoc?
* Can the user override the above locally? Needed for Bookdown...
* Can I change the version for clavertondown or does this depend on Pandoc version? If the latter, what is the Pandoc version we need as a minimum?

## Confirmed not working in current setup

Confirmed not working in Clavertondown with the current setup and this does produce 2.7.2

## Tests

* Can I use pandoc_args to change the default MathJax used by Pandoc?
