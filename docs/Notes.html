<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>ClavertonDown is aimed at staff at the University of Bath which is located on Claverton Down. It uses knitr, RMarkdown and Bookdown and aims to produce a system for creating sets of lecture notes in a variety of formats, including those which are technically accessible and those which are often preferred by disabled students. We aim for the system to be usable in both pure and applied mathematical settings. Requests to adapt the system or the outputs of the system to meet these goals will be considered by MASH. The main contact email address is <a href="mailto:mash-access@bath.ac.uk" class="email">mash-access@bath.ac.uk</a> but you should use the Team set up by the Centre for Learning and Teaching for support in the first instance.</p>
<p>This document is <strong>also</strong> a work in progress. Like everything right now!</p>
</div>
<div id="what-formats-do-i-need-to-produce-and-why" class="section level1" number="1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> What formats do I need to produce and why?</h1>
<p>ClavertonDown can produce:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML book</li>
<li>HTML page</li>
<li>Standard, clear and large print PDF</li>
<li>Word document</li>
<li>EPub book</li>
</ul>
<p>From a technical point of view only three of these formats of mathematical text are accessible:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML using MathJax to render all mathematical text (HTML book and page)
<ul>
<li>HTML formats must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements and use MathJax to render all mathematical text.</li>
<li>You can check your document meets the legal requirement of WCAG 2.1 Level AA with e.g. <a href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview">Accessibility Insights for Web plugin for Chrome</a></li>
<li>You can check it is MathJax by right clicking on the expression (try it in the HTML version):
<span class="math display">\[x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Word document using in-built Equation Editor for all mathematical text
<ul>
<li>Word formats must pass the in-built Accessibility Checker and use the in-built Equation Editor for all mathematical text.</li>
<li>You can use the in-built Word Accessibility Checker and information on <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/make-your-word-documents-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-d9bf3683-87ac-47ea-b91a-78dcacb3c66d">Making your Word documents accessible</a> to check your document.</li>
<li>You can use Review -&gt; Read Aloud (Alt + Ctrl + Space) to check the maths</li>
</ul></li>
<li>EPub3 using MathML for all mathematical text:
<ul>
<li>If the HTML format is accessible then the EPub3 output from ClavertonDown will be also</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The output from ClavertonDown will meet these requirements as far as possible. However, we cannot stop you from doing things which will fail to meet requirements. In particular, if you use images, sound, videos, colour or interactive/dynamic elements within the HTML you will need to ensure that you have done so within the accessibility requirements.</p>
<div id="why-do-we-still-supply-inaccessible-pdfs" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Why do we still supply inaccessible PDFs?</h2>
<p>It isn’t possible to create accessible PDFs using LaTeX. Even if a PDF is accessible the mathematical text within it will <strong>still be technically inaccessible</strong> regardless of how the PDF has been produced but…</p>
<ul>
<li>not all accessibility is about technical access - for some a clear or large print PDF is best</li>
<li>currently, clear print is selected most often by disabled students in the Department of Mathematical Sciences</li>
<li>PDF remains the best fallback when a student is concerned that a document is not being rendered as the author intended</li>
<li>PDF remains the best starting point for creating hard copy resources which is important for some disabled students</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, our aim here is to produce choice for <em>all</em> students, disabled or not, and many will still select PDF.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-i-really-have-to-put-all-this-on-moodle" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Do I really have to put all this on Moodle?</h2>
<p>If you use the same set up as this example document then all the outputs will be collected together into a single folder. We recommend that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zip up the folder and upload it to Moodle <em>as a file</em></li>
<li>Select Add a resource -&gt; File. Give the resource a name (e.g. lecture notes 1).</li>
<li>Add the zip file. Right click on the zip file, a window appears, click on unzip and wait until complete.</li>
<li>Right click on the zip again and click on delete. You will have a folder remaining.</li>
<li>Left click on the folder to open it.</li>
<li>Find the main file index.html and right click on this,
a window appears, click on Set main file.</li>
<li>Change any other settings you wish in the resource and then save.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you click on this resource you will see the HTML book version of the notes. This is technically accessible, searchable and usable on a mobile device. In the menu at the top there is a download button, from here a student can access any of the other formats. This is as close as we can get to replicating the Blackboard Ally student experience of being able to transform accessible resources to other formats.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="theorems-and-stuff" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Theorems and stuff</h1>
<p>You will notice that there are a variety of ways that theorem type environments are presented in the different formats. All of these pass technical accessibility tests or are following RNIB Clear Print guidelines and have been used for at least a decade in our provision for disabled students. We have also take on feedback that in HTML formats colour might be helpful to show where environments start and finish. We have chosen to impose a structured colour scheme on you, for now. The colours have been chosen so that they pass accessibility tests for contrast with the text.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t mean we have got it right. Give us feedback. Ideally, get students to give feedback too.</p>

<div id="thm:thm1" class="bookdown-theorem" custom-style="TheoremStyle">

<p>You can make new unnumbered theorem environments. You can call them whatever you like. They work kind of like the inbuilt ones but the environment is always newtheorem and the env defines the type.</p>
<p>You need to have predefined the type and made any changes to the standard print style in the file _bookdown.yml. Please see the file in the same folder as this file.</p>
<p>You can’t control what things look like in the other formats as they have been designed with a variety of accessibility features. If you don’t like how they look then maybe contact us and ask about it. It might be something we can think about changing or allowing author control or, it might not.</p>

<p>You can create new numbered theorem types. Unlike inbuilt environments, for them to be numbered in all formats they <em>must</em> have a label. If you forget then they won’t be numbered in any format <em>except</em> for PDF and then your numbering won’t match. I might try and fix this at some point. You can number them alone or with other inbuilt or newtheorem environments.</p>
<p>You need to have predefined the type, the numbering and made any changes to the standard print style in the file _bookdown.yml. Please see the file in the same folder as this file.</p>
<p>Take care not to reuse the inbuilt numbering labels with your new theorems! This will lead to odd things happening. The inbuilt labels to avoid are: thm, lem, cor, prp, cnj, def, exm, exr, fig, tab and eq.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>References still work in the same way as in Bookdown. Now go to theorem <a href="#thm:thm1">2.1</a> or proposition <a href="#prp:prp1">2.2</a>.</p>
Here is some text which is not part of the below example.

<div class="Examples">
<span class="Examples"><strong> Examples: </strong></span>
<div>
You can turn off the colour and padding in html, ePub and Word for any newtheorem or inbuilt theorem type. You do this in the _bookdown.yml file by adding the theorem name to the colouroff style_with list.

<p>This is a test. So, you need an empty line before and after the above for it to be a float. At the end of an environment this means that you need TWO empty lines. This is Pandoc.</p>
